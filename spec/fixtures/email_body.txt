Dear Nat,

I am the volunteer who is helping with keeping track of online raffle ticket sales.

We have set aside a batch of physical tickets for online purchasers - and, prior to the draw (17 October 2016), purchasers will be allocated the quantity of tickets they have purchased and the physical tickets will go in the draw.

Your ticket numbers are:

A12

A13


On the day of the draw there will be a printed list of all online purchaser names and the tickets they have been allocated - giving serial number of each ticket, and individuals who have purchased online can ask to see what tickets they have been allocated. If an online purchased ticket is drawn the list will be checked to identify the purchaser. If the purchaser is not present at the draw, they will be contacted by email to let them know which artwork(s) they have won.

The artworks are now on display at The Mill and I do hope you might be able to come along to look at them - and then join us on 17 October 2016 for the gala day and grand draw. The gala day starts at 10am and the draw starts at 3pm.

Thank you very much for your generous support for The Mill - and wishing you luck in the draw.

Andi Studer (Mill Volunteer)
